On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the fighting of World War I ended in 1918.  Due to the conclusion of the "War to end all Wars," November 11th became a universally recognized day of celebration. The day was originally declared Armistice Day. Then later, it was renamed Veterans' Day to honor all veterans who served America in war and defended democracy. So, today we honor all of our veterans who unselfishly placed their lives on the line for our freedom. Those men and women were ordinary people until they heard the call of duty and answered it. They left their families, their homes, and their lives - not for recognition or fame or even the honor we bestow upon them today. They fought to protect our country to maintain our way of life. If we want to preserve our freedoms, we must put them into action, for example, by voting in elections or speaking out against injustices. We must also ensure that everyone feels the benefits of freedom. Thank you for honoring our veterans today. Let us walk toward tomorrow still honoring them by living in the freedom they protected.
